# About Me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Katie May and I am a DevOps Engineer at GitHub based in Buffalo, New York. I specialize in creating developer tools that improve productivity and streamline workflows, particularly around GitHub API integration and automation.

## Professional Background

As a DevOps Engineer, I focus on:

- Developing GitHub CLI extensions for organization management and migration tools
- Creating automation solutions for GitHub Enterprise
- Building tools that facilitate migrations between different Git platforms
- Implementing best practices for GitHub Actions, Environments, and Security configurations

## GitHub CLI Extensions

I've developed several CLI extensions for GitHub that help administrators, developers, and DevOps teams manage their GitHub environments more efficiently:

### [gh-environments](https://github.com/katiem0/gh-environments)
A GitHub CLI extension to list and create environment metadata, including secrets and variables. This tool helps teams manage GitHub Environments across repositories by:
- Listing and reporting on environment configurations
- Creating environments with proper protection rules
- Managing environment secrets and variables consistently

### [gh-seva](https://github.com/katiem0/gh-seva)
A GitHub CLI extension for managing Secrets and Variables across organizations and repositories:
- Export and import secrets and variables between organizations
- Create reports of variable and secret access patterns
- Set up proper access controls for organizational secrets

### [gh-migrate-rulesets](https://github.com/katiem0/gh-migrate-rulesets)
This extension helps organizations create and manage repository rulesets:
- Generate reports of existing rulesets across repositories
- Migrate rulesets between organizations
- Ensure consistent branch protection and workflow rules

### [gh-bbc-exporter](https://github.com/katiem0/gh-bbc-exporter)
A migration tool that helps teams move from Bitbucket Cloud to GitHub Enterprise Cloud:
- Creates export archives in the proper format for GitHub Enterprise Importer
- Preserves repository metadata, git objects, and pull request information
- Simplifies the migration process with proper mappings

### [gh-organization-webhooks](https://github.com/katiem0/gh-organization-webhooks)
A tool for managing organization-level webhooks:
- Create reports of existing organizational webhooks
- Migrate webhooks between organizations
- Simplify webhook management for administrators

## Open Source Contributions

I'm passionate about open source development and regularly contribute to the GitHub community. All of my CLI extensions are open source and available on GitHub under the MIT license.
