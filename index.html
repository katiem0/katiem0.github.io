# About Me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Katie May and I am a DevOps Engineer at GitHub based in Buffalo, New York. I specialize in creating developer tools that improve productivity and streamline workflows, particularly around GitHub API integration and automation.

## Professional Background

As a DevOps Engineer, I focus on:

- Developing GitHub CLI extensions for organization management and migration tools
- Creating automation solutions for GitHub Enterprise
- Building tools that facilitate migrations between different Git platforms
- Implementing best practices for GitHub Actions, Environments, and Security configurations

## CLI Extensions

I've developed several GitHub CLI extensions that help administrators, developers, and DevOps teams manage their GitHub environments more efficiently. Check out my [CLI Extensions](/projects/) page for details on all available tools.

## Open Source Contributions

I'm passionate about open source development and regularly contribute to the GitHub community. All of my CLI extensions are open source and available on GitHub under the MIT license.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work or want to collaborate on projects!
