# About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm Katie May

I'm a Senior Service Delivery Engineer at GitHub, based in New York. I specialize in helping organizations transform their development workflows through innovative automation and tooling.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about building bridges between complex technical systems and the people who use them. My work focuses on:

🚀 **Developer Experience** - Creating CLI tools that make developers' lives easier  
🔧 **Automation & Migration** - Building solutions that streamline platform transitions  
💡 **GitHub Expertise** - Helping teams unlock the full potential of GitHub Enterprise  
🎯 **Customer Success** - Leading transformation engagements for GitHub Copilot adoption

## My Journey

My path in tech has taken me through various roles that shaped my holistic approach to DevOps:

- **GitHub** (Current) - Senior Service Delivery Engineer, driving enterprise transformations
- **CircleCI** - Senior DevOps Customer Engineer, optimizing CI/CD workflows
- **M&T Bank** - Developed containerized solutions for OpenShift/Kubernetes platforms

This diverse background gives me a unique perspective on the entire development lifecycle, from code to deployment.
